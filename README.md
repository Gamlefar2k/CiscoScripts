A small collection of scripts to automate work with Cisco switches.

**clipboard.py**

A quick and simple script to run a set of commands on a Cisco switch and 
feed the output to the clipboard on the users computer.
The output will list the hostname first, then the command and relevant
output will follow.

The basis of the script is copied from Vandyke.
